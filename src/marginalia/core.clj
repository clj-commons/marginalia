;; ## A new way to think about programs
;;
;; What if your code and its documentation were one and the same?
;;
;; Much of the philosophy guiding literate programming is the realization of the answer to this question.
;; However, if literate programming stands as a comprehensive programming methodology at one of end of the
;; spectrum and no documentation stands as its antithesis, then Marginalia falls somewhere between. That is,
;; you should always aim for comprehensive documentation, but the shortest path to a useful subset is the
;; commented source code itself.
;;
;; ## The art of Marginalia
;;
;; If you’re fervently writing code that is heavily documented, then using Marginalia for your Clojure projects
;; is as simple as running it on your codebase. However, if you’re unaccustomed to documenting your source, then
;; the guidelines herein will help you make the most out of Marginalia for true-power documentation.
;;
;; Following the guidelines will work to make your code not only easier to follow – it will make it better.
;; The very process of using Marginalia will help to crystalize your understanding of problem and its solution(s).
;;
;; The quality of the prose in your documentation will often reflect the quality of the code itself thus highlighting
;; problem areas. The elimination of problem areas will solidify your code and its accompanying prose. Marginalia
;; provides a virtuous circle spiraling inward toward maximal code quality.
;;
;; ## The one true way
;;
;; 1. Start by running Marginalia against your code
;; 2. Cringe at the sad state of your code commentary
;; 3. Add docstrings and code comments as appropriate
;; 4. Generate the documentation again
;; 5. Read the resulting documentation
;; 6. Make changes to code and documentation so that the “dialog” flows sensibly
;; 7. Repeat from step #4 until complete
